                Hi! Iâ€™m Yash Choudhary, a software developer with a love for building thoughtful, user-focused digital experiences. Iâ€™m currently studying Computational Mathematics at the University of Waterloo, where Iâ€™m diving deep into software development, data science, and the fascinating world of AI and machine learning. I enjoy working on full-stack projects, especially ones that challenge me to blend creativity with logic.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                Outside of code, Iâ€™m big on staying activeâ€”I lift weights, hike whenever I can, and never say no to a good night walk or a spontaneous beach visit. Iâ€™m also someone who loves being around people, whether thatâ€™s a laid-back get-together or a night out dancing. Fashion is another big part of who I amâ€”thereâ€™s something about finding your own style that feels just as creative as writing code.              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                I grew up loving PokÃ©mon, and it still holds a nostalgic place in my heart, which is why it became the theme for this portfolio. To me, learning new technologies and leveling up my skills is kind of like training: a journey of growth, curiosity, and fun. Thanks for stopping byâ€”feel free to explore and reach out if you want to connect!            
                </p>

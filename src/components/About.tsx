                I'm a passionate full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience 
                creating modern web applications. Like a skilled Pokemon trainer, I've mastered 
                React, Node.js, and cloud technologies, with a strong focus on user experience and performance.

              <p className="text-lg">
                My journey in web development started with a curiosity about how things work 
                on the internet - much like exploring the digital world of Minecraft! Since then, 
                I've had the privilege of working with startups, agencies, and large corporations, 
                helping them craft their digital adventures.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing 
                to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community 
                through blog posts and mentoring. Always ready for the next challenge! âš¡
